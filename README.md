# Registration-and-profiling-of-900000-Rohingya-refugees-in-Bangladesh-coxsbazar-operation

## Background: 
With the arrival of over 700,000 Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh in August 2017, the total number of Rohingya refugees in Coxâ€™s Bazar district increased to nearly one million, mostly occupying the conserved forest land surrounding the existing two refugee camps (Kutupalong Registered Camp and Nayapara Registered Camp), resulting in massive deforestation in the area as people cut down trees for firewood and to build shelters. The natural biodiversity of this reserve forest zone was deeply affected including disruption to the elephant corridor. 

Following the influx of August 2017, UNHCR and the Government of Bangladesh embarked on a joint registration exercise in order to consolidate registration data for the Rohingya population and issue documentation for all refugees, including previously unregistered refugees who entered Bangladesh following the 1992 cut-off date for registration.
